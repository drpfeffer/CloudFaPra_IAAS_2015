Discussion: Does it make sense at all to “load-balance” between these WordPress instances? Remember that currently each WordPress instance has its own separate database in the background.

No, it does not.
The current approach provides two different blogs, operating on their own database respectively.
However, two WordPress instances operating both on the same database could balance the webserver load for a single website.
The database would remain a bottleneck though.
