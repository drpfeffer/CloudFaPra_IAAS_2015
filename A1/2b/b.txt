A webserver hosted on EC2 instances provides the client front-end for
operations such es viewing or uploading videos. Necessary metadata
is queried from DynamoDB by the front-end.
An uploaded video is stored with Amazon S3, which in turn triggers
a Job Manager to process the newly uploaded video. This Job Manager
is enqueuing the jobs, which are processed by Amazon Elastic Transcoder.
The transcoded videos are stored on S3, while the corresponding metadata
is inserted into DynamoDB.
