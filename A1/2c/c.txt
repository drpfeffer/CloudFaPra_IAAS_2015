The web shop application is hosted on EC2 instances. The database of the web shop is hosted on AWS RDS instances. Both parts are duplicated in at least two different availability zones. So it's possible that echt part or even a complete data center may fail and the web shop can still be used. The different database instances are synchronized. The load is distributed by the load balancer Elastic Load Balancing. The load balancer is also able to detect failing instances and distributes the traffic to the remaining health instances.
